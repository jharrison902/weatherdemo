# weatherdemo

A sample weather app

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Using the Demo

You'll need your own api key from https://openweathermap.org to plugin into the LocationWeather constructor. The app will otherwise throw an error.

## About

This is just a quick sample app meant to show off the ease of developing with flutter and dart. I threw this together in a few hours based off a quick skim of the documentation. I'm honestly quite impressed by the array of libraries and plugins that already exist for this framework.

In essence, when the app starts, it will attempt to obtain the user's location and then receive some basic weather information for that location.
